Project to the MI-MVI on FIT, CTU.
## WHAT IS IT?

Model is trying to develop smart fish. Model is using genetic algorithm. Fish are trying to eat foods.

## HOW IT WORKS

There are always 20 fish and 40 plants. Every fish has a neuron with 3 inputs and one output.

Inputs are:

* X coordination of a normalized vector (fish -> nearest plant).
* Y coordination of a normalized vector (fish -> nearest plant).
* The heading from the fish towards the point of the nearest plant (x,y).

Output is:

* How many degrees should fish turn to the right.

## HOW TO USE IT

At first run Setup button. Then You can choose speed of every fish and how many ticks will generation survive.

If you push go everything will start.


## EXTENDING THE MODEL

Model is not perfect. Maybe will be better with other inputs or more outputs.
